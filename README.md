# The_Interview_Attendance_Problem
The Interview Attendance Problem is a data set for predicting whether or not a job candidate will show up to the job interview based on a set of parameters.

In this graph we see that the Gradient Classifier model did the best job of predicting a 'Yes' or 'No' in the Observed Attendance for a job interview.
